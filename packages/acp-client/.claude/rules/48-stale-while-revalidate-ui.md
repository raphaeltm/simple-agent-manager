# Stale-While-Revalidate UI (No Hiding, No Refetch Loops)

## Why This Rule Exists

On 2026-07-10 the project settings page became unusable: after creating an
invite link, the entire settings UI unmounted and slowly rebuilt every ~1
second, forever. The loop was a chain of three anti-patterns that each looked
harmless in isolation:

1. `ToastProvider` passed an inline object as its context value
   (`value={{ addToast, success, error, ... }}`), so **every toast state
   change gave every toast consumer a new context identity** — even though all
   five functions were individually `useCallback`-stable.
2. Data loaders were declared as `useCallback(load, [projectId, toast])` and
   triggered by `useEffect(() => { void load(); }, [load])`. The new toast
   identity recreated the loader, which re-fired the effect, which refetched.
3. Loaders called `setLoading(true)` on every run and components rendered
   `{loading ? <Spinner/> : <content>}`, so each refetch **unmounted the
   content**. When a loader's `catch` called `toast.error(...)`, the failure
   toast itself re-triggered the loader — a self-sustaining loop with period ≈
   fetch latency.

`AuthProvider` (unmemoized context value, re-emitting on every BetterAuth
session refetch/focus) and `Project.tsx` (swapping the entire `<Outlet/>` for
a spinner on every `reload()`) amplified the blast radius to the whole app.

## Hard Rules

### 1. Context provider values MUST be memoized

Every `<X.Provider value={...}>` must receive a `useMemo`-stable value (or a
value from state/ref). Never an inline object/array literal, and never an
unmemoized `const value = {...}` built during render.

Enforced by ESLint: `react/jsx-no-constructed-context-values` is `error` for
all `.tsx` files (see `eslint.config.mjs`). Do not disable it inline; fix the
provider instead.

```tsx
// GOOD
const value = useMemo(() => ({ user, isLoading, reload }), [user, isLoading, reload]);
return <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>;
```

The functions inside the value must themselves be `useCallback`-stable, or the
`useMemo` is pointless.

### 2. Never put a context-object dependency in a data-loader's deps

`useCallback(load, [projectId, toast])` + `useEffect(..., [load])` means "refetch
whenever the toast context changes identity." Even with memoized providers this
couples fetching to unrelated state. Instead:

- Depend only on the identifiers that define WHAT to fetch (`projectId`, ids,
  filters).
- Context values like `toast` are stable after Rule 1 — but still prefer
  referencing them without listing the whole context object when only stable
  member functions are used.
- NEVER call `toast.error(...)` (or any state-setting function that can feed
  back into the loader's deps) from a loader's `catch` unless you have verified
  the dependency chain cannot re-trigger the loader.

### 3. Loading spinners only when there is NO data (stale-while-revalidate)

A refetch must never unmount already-rendered content:

```tsx
// BAD — content unmounts on every refetch
{
  loading ? <Spinner /> : <Content data={data} />;
}

// GOOD — spinner only before first data; refetches keep content visible
{
  data === null ? <Spinner /> : <Content data={data} />;
}
```

- Track "have we ever loaded" (`data !== null`, or a `hasLoadedRef`) separately
  from "a fetch is in flight" (`isFetching`).
- `setLoading(true)` at the top of every loader run is wrong unless it is
  guarded to the first load.
- Parent layouts (e.g. `Project.tsx`) must never swap a mounted `<Outlet/>` /
  child tree for a spinner during a background `reload()` — that destroys all
  child state. Only the very first load for a given entity may gate rendering.

This extends `.claude/rules/16-no-page-reload-on-mutation.md`: not only is
`window.location.reload()` banned after mutations, so is any refetch pattern
that visually resets the page.

### 4. Prefer TanStack Query for new/modified fetch surfaces

The app has a configured TanStack Query v5 client (`apps/web/src/lib/query-client.ts`,
wired in the app root). For any NEW data-fetching surface, and when materially
modifying an existing one, use `useQuery`/`useMutation` instead of hand-rolled
`useState + useCallback + useEffect` loader triplets:

- `isLoading` (no data yet) vs `isFetching` (background refresh) gives
  stale-while-revalidate for free — gate render on `isLoading` only.
- Use `queryClient.invalidateQueries(...)` after mutations instead of
  `await reload()` chains threaded through context.
- Use `refetchInterval` instead of hand-rolled `setInterval` polls.
- Every authenticated query key must include the resolved user identity (or an
  equivalent tenant/session namespace). Clear the previous namespace and gate
  protected children while that identity changes so cached data from one
  account can never render for another account, even for a single frame.

Hand-rolled loaders are only acceptable for genuinely non-query state
(WebSockets, streaming, imperative one-shots).

### 5. Responsive shells MUST preserve routed subtree identity

Changing between mobile and desktop chrome must not remount the routed page,
chat, composer, or media subtree. When breakpoint branches use different
sibling structures, give shared stateful slots stable keys (or keep one shared
slot outside the branches) so React can reconcile them across positions.

Every responsive shell change must include a portrait-to-landscape regression
test that crosses the actual breakpoint and proves local child state and mount
identity survive. A static test at one viewport is insufficient.

## Interaction-Effect Trace Requirement

When adding any state change that a `useEffect` in the same tree observes
(including via context identity), trace the loop per
`.claude/rules/06-technical-patterns.md` → "React Interaction-Effect Analysis":
what re-renders, what identities change, which effects re-fire, and can the
effect's own side effects re-trigger it? A cycle anywhere in that graph is a
merge blocker.

## Quick Compliance Check

Before committing UI data-fetching or context changes:

- [ ] Every `Provider value=` is `useMemo`-stable (lint enforces this)
- [ ] No loader `useCallback` lists a context object (e.g. `toast`) in deps
- [ ] No loader `catch` sets state that can re-trigger the loader
- [ ] Spinners gate only on "no data yet", never on "refetch in flight"
- [ ] Mutations invalidate/refresh data without unmounting visible content
- [ ] New fetch surfaces use TanStack Query (or document why not)
- [ ] Authenticated query keys are identity-scoped and account transitions are gated
- [ ] Breakpoint changes preserve routed and media subtree identity
